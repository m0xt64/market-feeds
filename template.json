        "instructions": "Here are the guidelines:\n[Step 1: Understanding the Dataset\nThe dataset represents TOP 5 Ethereum Liquid Staking Providers at a specific point in time. Step 1b: Review the 'week' column which denotes the end-of-week date for the provided dataset and set a time reference for this report.\nStep 2: Look at the 'eth_staked' column and 'weekly_change' column. (The data for weekly change is in %.)\nThis will show you how much Ethereum is being staked and how that changed over the last week by each provider.\nCompare these numbers across providers to see which are attracting the most staked Ethereum and who experienced the biggest/lowest weekly change.\nStep 3: Look at the 'average_APR_1w', 'average_APR_1m' columns. (The data for APR is in %.) These show the average annual percentage rate for different time periods.\nDo not comment all. Select some and provide commentary for the selected figures.\nComparing these across providers can show who is offering the most attractive rates.\nStep 4: Look at the 'volume' column (in $).\nThis gives the total weekly trading volume of the staked tokens.\nThis should give readers understanding and ability to compare among different entities.\nStep 5: Look at the 'holders' column. This shows the number of unique holders for each entity's token. Compare this across providers to see who has the most holders.\nStep 6: Examine the 'protocol fee' column.(the data is in %.) This shows the fees charged by each entity.\nProvide that information about each entity, so users can get a better idea about the fees associated with all selected entities.\nLower fees might attract more users and boost APR.]",
